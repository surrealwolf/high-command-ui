# Campaign Detail Display Updates - Final Polish

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Redundant Information**
- Removed "PLANET:" field - Already displayed as selected planet
- Removed "PLANET HEALTH:" progress bar - Not relevant to campaign status
- Removed duplicate "CAMPAIGN PROGRESS:" bar

### 2. **Enhanced Event Type Display**
Added emoji indicators for event type with full details:
- `‚öîÔ∏è TYPE: ATTACK` - Direct assault on planet
- `üõ°Ô∏è TYPE: DEFENSE` - Defending against attack
- `üí£ TYPE: SABOTAGE` - Sabotage mission

Event type now shows both emoji and full text label for clarity.

### 3. **Renamed Defenders to Hell Divers**
- Changed label from `DEFENDERS:` to `üëæ HELL DIVERS:`
- Added Hell Diver emoji for thematic consistency
- Shows current player count defending the planet

### 4. **Campaign Timeline Information**
Added temporal context to campaigns:
- **STARTED:** Campaign start timestamp
- **EXPIRES:** Campaign deadline timestamp
- Both formatted to locale date/time
- Helps players understand campaign urgency

### 5. **Campaign Progress Bar**
- Single "PROGRESS:" bar showing campaign.planet.event progress
- Displays health/maxHealth with bar visualization
- Removed duplicate progress displays
- Keeps focus on attack/defense progress, not planet health

### 6. **Planet Pulsing Animation (No Color Change)**
Changed from orange color to animated pulsing ring:
- **Before:** Orange (#ff8800) solid planet color
- **After:** Original planet color + faction-colored pulsing ring

#### Animation Details
```css
@keyframes campaign-pulse {
  0%:   r: 20px,  opacity: 0.6, stroke-width: 2
  50%:  r: 28px,  opacity: 0.2, stroke-width: 1
  100%: r: 20px,  opacity: 0.6, stroke-width: 2
}
```

- Duration: 2 seconds, infinite loop, ease-in-out
- Pulse color based on attacking faction (from `getEventColor()`)
- Creates a "ripple" effect emanating from the planet
- Indicates campaign activity without changing planet owner color

### 7. **Campaign Detail Card Order**
```
Campaign Details (Updated Order):
1. Campaign ID
2. ‚öîÔ∏è Event Type (with emoji)
3. Attacking Faction
4. Started (timestamp)
5. Expires (timestamp)
6. Progress (bar + numbers)
7. üëæ Hell Divers (player count)
8. Success Rate (percentage)
```

## Visual Changes
