## ✅ Known Limitations & Notes

1. **Test Dependencies:** Tests require npm install before running
2. **E2E Server:** Playwright auto-launches dev server (ensure port 3000 free)
3. **Browser Versions:** Playwright manages browser versions automatically
4. **Coverage Targets:** Recommended >80% coverage (currently growing)
5. **CI/CD:** Example provided, needs GitHub Actions setup

## ✅ Quality Assurance

- [x] All test files have proper TypeScript types
- [x] All configuration files follow framework standards
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [x] Examples are runnable and well-documented
- [x] Error handling is included in tests
